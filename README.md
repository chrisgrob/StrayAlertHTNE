## The Problem

Currently, if you encounter a stray pet on the street, you have to get close enough to see its tag
in order to get in contact with the owner. In the case of dogs, this can sometimes be difficult, as
the dog may be aggressive or they may run away when approached. In other cases, a person may
retrieve the collar info but the owner may be unresponsive, and the person may not have much time
to stick around. Or, in the worst case, the animal in question may not even have a collar, so the
owner is impossible to find.
